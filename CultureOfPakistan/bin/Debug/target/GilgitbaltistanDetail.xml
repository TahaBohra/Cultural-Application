    <description>Gyal</description>
    <largeDescription>Gyal is a traditional local breakfast food, wheat pan-fried cakes with honey or fruit jam and the local favorite ingredient, apricot oil. The apricot oil creates such a sweet aroma to go with the smoky flavors from the charcoal or wood used in cooking. There are several different types of gyal, and the thing I love about this dish is how it is so simple and hearty, the perfect combination for a morning cup of buttery hot milk tea.</largeDescription>
